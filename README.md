# Snake Game

A classic Snake game with a twist - you feed the snake by placing your cursor on the board.

## Why I built this

Get familiar WITH  with Next.js, TypeScript, tRPC, React Query.

Found this snake game concept on Product Hunt and wanted to recreate the childhood classic with a unique cursor-feeding mechanic.

Originally planned to use LLM for predicting moves, but ran into errors so implemented custom logic instead.
